## Try my app!

The attached files **DO NOT** work as a standalone project, they are just the code I wrote (lib folder) and pubspecs (dependencies).

To give the app a try:
-  [Download the Flutter SDK and Android Studio or Xcode](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
-  Start a virtual device in Android Studio or Xcode.
-  Clone my repository and move to that location in your terminal.
-  Run `flutter create .` in the terminal. (this will create all the app dependencies).
-  Run `flutter run`. The virtual device will open the app automatically.
-  That's it!
